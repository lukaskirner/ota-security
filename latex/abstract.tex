\textbf{The number of IoT devices worldwide are rapidly increasing. Transferring data from IoT devices brought in various security problems. Vulnerabilities in software isn't uncommon. Updating devices can reduce or eliminate the possibility of an attacker exploiting a vulnerability in the running software. The capability of updating these devices can minimize the risk of a compromise over vulnerabilities in the software. But even the update process can be attacked. In most cases state-of-the-art technologies can be used to deliver updates in a secure manner. This paper presents common attack vectors and possible counter measures which can be applied to provide a secure update mechanism. A proof of concept will then show how a possible implementation of these counter measures can look like in the context of an ESP32.}
