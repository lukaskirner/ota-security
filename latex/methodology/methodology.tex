\section{Methodology}
The methodology of this paper is starting research about OTA firmware updates to understand the basic concepts. Subsequently, security keywords are searched which are then used in combination with OTA keywords to find the desired related works. The selected research keywords will narrow down and filter the research. The research question to be addressed by this paper are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item What are the attack vectors for OTA firmware updates in a microcontroller context?
    \item Which common security methods exist to counter the attack vectors?
    \item How to implement these security methods with the Espressif IoT Development Framework (esp-idf) on a ESP32?
\end{itemize}

This paper then provides knowledge about secure OTA firmware updates in the microcontroller context by answering the above research questions.
