\subsection{Challenges}
Of course security is the main challenge here as the paper focus on this specific topic. But additional security layers don't come for free. This paper focuses on secure OTA firmware updates on microcontrollers. Microcontrollers aren't built for doing heavy computing task, therefor the computational power is very limited. Extra task like OTA update needs resources from the system which could be missing in other places then \cite{Kolehmainen2018}. The efficient use of the device limited resources may also be a present challenge. Also on the reference of the energy consumption since some devices can be battery operated. In addition, firmware updates should not brick or destroy the device. Therefor automatic recovery or rollback mechanism should be implemented.
